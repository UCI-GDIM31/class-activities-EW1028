## Devlogs
### W1
Write your W1 activity Devlog here.
"Hello World"

### W2
Create future Devlog sub-headers with the three # symbols, then write your Devlogs below them.
1. The reason that using float instead of using int, str, or bool is becasue float is more accurate in here because there are some many colors we can choose.

2. The bounces is countable, you can able to count how many bounce there are. Float is more like a decimal that you cannot really count there is 1.1 bounce.

3. Forget to put a semi-colon.

### W3
Table 19: The playerâ€™s current sanity level is not effecting the the method SetLightDimness, as the player's current sanity level goes up, the SetLightDimness will goes not get brighter base on the sanity level. The SetLightDimnesswill just need to change by itself, or inside the method.



Mono Behaviour coding activity
1. A class is like a blueprint of a car. Components are the car parts such as engine, wheels. Variables are trails like color or speed. Methods are actions like drive or honk and parking.

2. They will get too bright becasue each bounce will add more and more light without resetting, making the emission stronger every single time.

Table 19: line 17 is decaring a new member variable, and the type is boolean. A basic C# data type which stores a true or false value. Line 28 is a if statement with it condition, it is saying that if the player press the space and the object is on the ground the code will work. it tests if the object is touching the ground. Which determines whether jumping is allowed. Line 32 is talking about when the object left the ground, it won't able to jump again, unitl grounded, which saying if any of the codition is not met, the code won't work.

Table 19:
1. I got into a trouble that my cat is walking in the sky. So I change my Edit Collider of the cat, making around the cat, not too much, not small, which letting the cat touches the ground. This is because Edit Collider decide how big the area is to collide others object. My cat and the ball have the Rigidbodies, and only the goal I check if the Is Trigger is on.

2. My game did not work at the first time that I tested it. I made two MadeGoal method, and I forgot when was I call. So, I deleted one MadeGoal method, and checked my code again.

### W5
Activity 1: 
What does transform.Translate() do in the unity?

transform.Translate() moves a GameObject in a certain direction by changing its position. It uses vectors to decide how far and which dierction to move. For example, transform.Translate (Vector3.up * Time.detlaTime) moves the object upward over time.
